- Your reasoning for the algorithm you chose
    I chose linear regression because I take in a value x and it should return a numerical value y. 
- An explanation and analysis of the output of your model: What results did your model produce? What do they mean?
    After training the linear regression model using 'total sulfur dioxide' as the independent variable (x) and 'free sulfur dioxide' as the dependent variable (y), the model generates coefficients for the linear equation (y = mx + c) that predicts 'free sulfur dioxide' based on 'total sulfur dioxide'.
- A prediction based on your model
    With 24 total sulfur dioxide, there will be 11.16 free sulfur dioxide
- A summary of the accuracy of your model
    The accuracy of the model, as indicated by the R-squared value of approximately 0.435, suggests that the linear regression model using 'total sulfur dioxide' to predict 'free sulfur dioxide' explains about 43.5% of the variability observed in 'free sulfur dioxide' based on this single feature.
- Real world implications
    A reliable model predicting 'free sulfur dioxide' in red wine based on 'total sulfur dioxide' levels can have practical applications in winemaking. Winemakers could use this predictive model to estimate 'free sulfur dioxide' concentrations during the production process, aiding in quality control and ensuring compliance with safety standards.
