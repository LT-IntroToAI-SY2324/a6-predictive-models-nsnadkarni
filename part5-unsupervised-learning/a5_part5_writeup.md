# Part 5 - Unsupervised Learning Writeup

After completing `a6_part5.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. Develop a name for each customer group based on the information from the graph. For example, one group might be called “Frugal” while another might be called “Shopaholic.” Explain your reasoning for each label.

Economical Shoppers: Poor, but they shop alot.
Frugal Savers: Poor, but they shop strategically so they dont shop much and they save their money.
Moderate Spenders: Average Pay, Average Shopping, nothing special
Luxury Enthusiasts: Have a lot of money and spend it lavishly.
Wealthy Savers: Have a lot of money, but they dont shop much so they hold on to their money

2. What group would a customer who has a medium income and low spending habits be in?

Frugal Savers, as they dont have alot of money, so they arent wealthy savers.

3. Choose one cluster of interest to you. How might the marketing team approach this specific customer group?

In the luxury enthusiast group, the marketing team can make a product that appeals to ones sense of belonging by making a limited edition (barely any made) premium product and appealing it to the luxury spenders. For example, they can create a car line which has certain features that are only available on 10 cars, with a huge markup, so these luxury enthusiasts feel like they are part of a special group.
