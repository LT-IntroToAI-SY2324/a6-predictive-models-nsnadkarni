# Part 1 - Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part1.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the r squared value?  What does this say about this lenear regression model?

The R Squared value is 0.626. This means that the model isnt perfect, but its not bad. Under 0.5 is bad and closer to 1 is good.

2. According to your model, what is the predicted systolic blood pressure for a person iwho is 43 years old?

The predicted blood pressure for a 43 year old is 137.462.

3. How accurate do you think this model's predictions are?  Do you think this model is accurate enough to reliably predict someone's blood pressure based on their age?  Why or why not?  And if not, what could improve the model?

The model is somewhat accurate but it shouldn't be relied on to give a perfectly accurate blood pressure by age. This is because the R squared value isn't very close to 1. To improve the model, we could add more data to the data set.
